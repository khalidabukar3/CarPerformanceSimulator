<h1 id="portfolio-part-4-abstract-class">Portfolio Part 4: Abstract Class</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong>: Khalid Abukar</li>
<li><strong>Dot Number</strong>: abukar.23</li>
<li><strong>Due Date</strong>: 03/22 @ 11:59 PM EST</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="assignment-overview">Assignment Overview</h2>
<p>Now that you've had a chance to refine your designs a bit, it's time to start
writing some code. In this assignment, you will be making your first abstract
class. The abstract class will take on the name <code>ComponentSecondary</code>, where
<code>Component</code> is the name of your component. For example, if you're making a
Point3D component, the abstract class would be called <code>Point3DSecondary</code> as
follows:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">abstract</span> <span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">Point3DSecondary</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">implements</span> <span class="hljs-title">Point3D</span> </span>{
   ...
}
</div></code></pre>
<p>Inside the abstract class, you will implement every secondary method you
specified in the enhanced interface. Because the secondary abstract class is
layered over the kernel interface, you cannot implement the methods of your
enhanced interface using the underlying representation. As a result, these
methods must be implemented using the kernel methods only.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, you have done this several times before without probably realizing
it. For example, when you first learned recursion in software 1, <a href="https://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/software/2221/web-sw1/extras/instructions/natural-number-static/natural-number-static.html">you were
tasked with implementing the secondary methods of NaturalNumber</a>. At the
time, they were static methods, but you were tasked with only implementing the
secondary methods using the kernel methods.</p>
<p>You did this a few other times as well. For example, we asked you to
<a href="https://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/software/2221/web-sw1/extras/instructions/set-instance-methods/set-instance-methods.html">implement the secondary methods for set at one point</a>. We did this by
having you extend <code>Set1L</code>, so you could override the implementation of
<code>remove()</code> and <code>add()</code>. At the time, we didn't force you to only use kernel
methods, but the premise remains the same. Meanwhile, in a later lab, you were
tasked with implementing the secondary method <code>sort()</code> of <code>Queue</code>.</p>
<p>Once you have implemented all of the secondary methods, you must also implement
the key <code>Object</code> methods. It's up to you to decide which ones you want to
implement, but <code>toString()</code> and <code>equals()</code> are a great start. You may also
implement <code>hashCode()</code> if you so choose. Note that these methods do not have
access to the representation, so you must also implement them using the kernel
methods only.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="assignment-learning-objectives">Assignment Learning Objectives</h2>
<p>Without learning objectives, there really is no clear reason why a particular
assessment or activity exists. Therefore, to be completely transparent, here is
what we're hoping you will learn through this particular aspect of the portfolio
project. Specifically, students should be able to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Generate a list of changes since the previous iteration of a project</li>
<li>Use the kernel and Standard methods to implement a series of secondary
methods that compile</li>
<li>Identify method preconditions and check them appropriately (i.e., follow
design-by-contract)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="assignment-rubric">Assignment Rubric</h2>
<p>Again, to be completely transparent, most of the portfolio project, except the
final submission, is designed as a formative assessment. Formative assessments
are meant to provide ongoing feedback in the learning process. Therefore,
the rubric is designed to assess the learning objectives <em>directly</em> in a way
that is low stakes—meaning you shouldn't have to worry about the grade. Just
do good work.</p>
<ol>
<li>(3 points) In keeping with the concept of iteration, the assignment must
detail all of the changes from most recent submission (i.e., since the
interfaces). Make sure to explain what was changed and why.</li>
<li>(4 points) The abstract class implementation must implement all methods
from the enhanced interface (i.e., all secondary methods), and these methods
must be implemented using only the kernel and Standard methods. In addition,
the abstract class must implement <code>toString()</code> and <code>equals()</code>, but you may
implement <code>hashCode()</code> as well. In general, the methods do not have to be
100% correct, but their logic must make sense (i.e., no low effort
implementations).</li>
<li>(3 points) When implementing the secondary methods, you must respect the
contracts of the kernel methods. In other words, if a kernel method has a
precondition, the client of the kernel method must check the precondition.
If there is no method available to check the precondition, it must be added
to the kernel.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="pre-assignment-tasks">Pre-Assignment Tasks</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Before you write any code, I would recommend that you sit down and try to map
out how you would implement your secondary methods given the constraint of
only using kernel methods. Is it possible?</p>
<p>Most likely, you are going to hit a bumb in the road in your design where the
kernel methods aren't quite enough to get you an implementation of a secondary
method. In that case, it is okay to update your design. All that I ask is that
you document your changes and why in this section. Here's what that might look
like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added a kernel method for <code>size()</code> because I am unable to check the
precondition of <code>remove()</code> without it.</li>
<li>Changed <code>getSignals()</code> method to <code>removeSignal()</code> method to eliminate
aliasing in my design.</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to use the template above when writing out your changes.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- TODO: include your changes to your design here -->
<h2 id="assignment-tasks">Assignment Tasks</h2>
<p>Your primary task for this assignment is to create an abstract class that falls
from the interfaces you previously designed. Because it is unlikely you have
done this before, consider browsing some examples in the API. Unfortunately,
there are not many. However, you might browse
<a href="https://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/software/common/doc/src-html/components/simplewriter/SimpleWriterSecondary.html">SimpleWriterSecondary</a> or
<a href="https://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/software/common/doc/src-html/components/simplereader/SimpleReaderSecondary.html">SimpleReaderSecondary</a>.</p>
<p>As with the previous assignment, you will share no code here. Instead, create
your abstract class file in <code>src</code>, and follow the submission instructions below.</p>
<h2 id="post-assignment-tasks">Post-Assignment Tasks</h2>
<p>The following sections detail everything that you should do once you've
completed the assignment.</p>
<h3 id="submission">Submission</h3>
<p>If you have completed the assignment using this template, we recommend that you
convert it to a PDF before submission. If you're not sure how, check out
this <a href="https://therenegadecoder.com/blog/how-to-convert-markdown-to-a-pdf-3-quick-solutions/">Markdown to PDF guide</a>. However, PDFs should be
created for you automatically every time you save, so just double check that
all your work is there before submitting.</p>
<p>In addition, the Java file you created should be submitted separately as a PDF.
This template includes the print to PDF extension, so you should be able to
click the print icon in the top right of this panel. In any case, do not copy
the Java code into this file.</p>
<h3 id="peer-review">Peer Review</h3>
<p>Following the completion of this assignment, you will be assigned three
students' component abstract classes for review. Please do not spend a ton of
time on your reviews, <strong>perhaps 10-15 minutes each</strong>. Your job during the peer
review process is to help your peers work through the logic of their implementations
and identify gaps in their use of design-by-contract (i.e., forgetting checks
for preconditions). If something seems wrong to you, it's probably a good hunch,
so make sure to point it out.</p>
<p>When reviewing your peers' assignments, please treat them with respect. We
recommend using the following feedback rubric to ensure that your feedback is
both helpful and respectful (you may want to render the markdown as HTML or a
PDF to read this rubric as a table).</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Criteria of Constructive Feedback</th>
<th>Missing</th>
<th>Developing</th>
<th>Meeting</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Specific</td>
<td>All feedback is general (not specific)</td>
<td>Some (but not all) feedback is specific and some examples may be provided.</td>
<td>All feedback is specific, with examples provided where possible</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Actionable</td>
<td>None of the feedback provides actionable items or suggestions for improvement</td>
<td>Some feedback provides suggestions for improvement, while some do not</td>
<td>All (or nearly all) feedback is actionable; most criticisms are followed by suggestions for improvement</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Prioritized</td>
<td>Feedback provides only major or minor concerns, but not both. Major and minar concerns are not labeled or feedback is unorganized</td>
<td>Feedback provides both major and minor concerns, but it is not clear which is which and/or the feedback is not as well organized as it could be</td>
<td>Feedback clearly labels major and minor concerns. Feedback is organized in a way that allows the reader to easily understand which points to prioritize in a revision</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Balanced</td>
<td>Feedback describes either strengths or areas of improvement, but not both</td>
<td>Feedback describes both strengths and areas for improvement, but it is more heavily weighted towards one or the other, and/or descusses both but does not clearly identify which part of the feedback is a strength/area for improvement</td>
<td>Feedback provides balanced discussion of the document's strengths and areas for improvement. It is clear which piece of feedback is which</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tactful</td>
<td>Overall tone and language are not appropriate (e.g., not considerate, could be interpreted as personal criticism or attack)</td>
<td>Overall feedback tone and language are general positive, tactul, and non-threatening, but one or more feedback comments could be interpretted as not tactful and/or feedback leans toward personal criticism, not focused on the document</td>
<td>Feedback tone and language are positive, tactful, and non-threatening. Feedback addesses the document, not the writer</td>
</tr>
